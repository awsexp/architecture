# AWS Expert Architecture diagrams, templates and other useful documents

All this content has been provided to help you become an AWS expert.

The goal of this repository is to provide you as much content as possible to help you apply what you have learned in certifications to the real world.

## Architecture

The Architecture Diagrams are generic diagrams that provide an idea of how to design resilient, secure systems and keep inline with AWS best practices as much as possible. These have been curated from my work over the last 10 years working with a range of different companies including government, enterprises, SMEs and startups.

Also you'll get to see how AWS environments are desiged in the real world and start to understand where trade offs have to be made for certain design decisions.

Examples of this will be highlighted in certain templates and diagrams where certain features could not be used due to budget, time or other constraints as they came up during a project.

The most important thing is make sure you are providing value to your business or customers as well as keep in mind some key principles around security, availability, automation and business alignment.

## Engineering documentation

Engineering documents and templates are used to provide "As Built" documentation and used for topics such as monitoring, support and security.

Documents are kept light as possible in the real world to ensure that as much information around environments is kept in source code/infrastructure as code repositories which include comments.

## Security, cost and protection auditing

In addition to the above you can make use of the documents I created as Principal Consultant/CEO for Teem for auditing cloud environments.

The auditing process does not replace the need for 3rd party tools and AWS security toolsets being used, but facilitates highlighting areas that can be improved in a customer's AWS environment.

### The 3 sections of an audit

I created what are called the "3 sections of an audit". These are:

- Security
- Cost Optimization
- Data Protection

### WARRANTY

No warranty is provided with this material and all effort has been made to cleanse and remove any identifying information in documents.
