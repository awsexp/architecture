### aws-app-architecture-simple.docx/AWS App Architecure for SMEs

This architecure document was created specifically for small businesses that have a limited budget. This provides them with a base line architecture that can be applied across their account and provide them with a minimum set of security guard rails.

### AWS IP Ranges and Security.xks

When you end up managing several AWS accounts and also involved in the setup of new accounts and VPCs for customers, this tool will be a useful starting point.

If you manage several AWS Accounts (e.g. I've had access to hundreds over the course of my career) and are an AWS partner, managed services company, IT support or a large enterprise company this spreadhseet will be useful for recording IP ranges you have applied to different AWS accounts.

Of course there are smarter ways to do this like having an automated way inside an asset management system, using infrastructure as code and environment variables etc... but this is a good starting point.
